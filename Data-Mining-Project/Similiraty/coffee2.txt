Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted green coffee beans, with a dark, bitter, and slightly acidic taste due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks and can be prepared in various ways, such as espresso, French press, caff√® latte, or canned coffee. The earliest evidence of coffee drinking as a modern beverage dates back to the 15th century in Yemen, where seeds were first roasted and brewed. Coffee beans were procured from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries and cultivated in Yemen. By the 16th century, the drink had spread to the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe. The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica and C. robusta. Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa. As of 2023, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee beans, producing 35% of the world's total. Green, unroasted coffee is traded as an agricultural commodity, but despite its global sales, farmers producing coffee beans disproportionately live in poverty. Critics of the coffee industry have pointed to its negative impact on the environment and the clearing of land for coffee-growing and water use. The global coffee industry is worth $495.50 billion as of 2023.
